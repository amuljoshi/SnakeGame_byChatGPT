# SnakeGame_byChatGPT

This is a simple snake game made using ChatGPT. 

To run the game, make sure you have pygame installed, and then run the code in a Python interpreter. 
The start menu will appear, and you can press 'C' to start the game and 'Q' to exit. 
In the game, use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake. 
The snake will grow longer as it eats the food that appears randomly on the screen. 
If the snake hits the edge of the screen or itself, the game will end and the score will be displayed on the screen. 
You can then press 'C' to play again or 'Q' to quit the game.
